SayClip is a voice-to-text transcription application based on Python, WebView <sub><sup>(no Chromium, webview is just more swag)</sup></sub> and Whisper, that converts spoken words from your microphone into editable text for convenient pasting! \(＾▽＾)/ 

Actual README, description, and other stuff will be added later (¬‿¬)
